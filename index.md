SYLLABUS

Show what topics will be covered.

1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
intend to teach.
4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.

  you will need access to software as described below.  
  You will also need an account on the new UChicago Tier 3 Center, as well as an up-to-date web browser.

  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the

<h3 id="uchicagoaccount">Getting UChicago Tier3 Account</h3>
<p>
The UChicago analysis facility has an account authorization protocol, so 
use your institutional or CERN identity when signing up so that it is easier 
to verify people's identity and keep track of information.

<p>
Instructions to request an account and star working on the facility can be found here: <br>
